- 🔭 I'm currently working on extremely space-efficient approximate membership query (think: Bloom filter 🌸) & retrieval (perfect hash static function) data structures
- 📖 My dissertation was on communication-efficient probabilistic algorithms for Big Data problems. [You can read it here.](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000127719/96591782)
- 🏢 I'm open for interesting jobs in Munich!
- 📫 Contact me at my username @ the domain in my profile
